# Quantitative Finance – Mini Projects  
*Author: **Guoqin Liu***  

This repository contains four self-contained mini-projects completed during the 2025 Erdős Institute Quantitative Finance course.  
Each explores a different layer of market-risk or derivative analytics while sharing a common, fully-reproducible Python tool-chain.

## 💡 Project Snapshots
| Folder | Topic | One-line Goal |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| `Mini Project 1` | **High- vs Low-Risk Portfolio** | Contrast defensive vs. aggressive 5-stock baskets using 5-year betas and momentum filters |
| `Mini Project 2` | **Normality Tests on ETF Returns** | Test Gaussian‐return assumption for SPY, QQQ, IWM, TLT, GLD over 2010-2025 |
| `Mini Project 3` | **Black–Scholes Sensitivities** | Visualise how option price & Δ vary with spot and time for an OTM call / ITM put |
| `Mini Project 4` | **Δ- & σ-Hedging under Stochastic Vol** | Quantify residual P&L after daily delta-hedging and test a vega-neutral overlay |

Each folder contains:  

* **`.ipynb`** – Jupyter notebook with code, narrative, and results.  
* **`.pdf`** – Slide deck used to collect observations, methods, and conclusions.  
* **Figures** (PNG) – Key plots exported from the notebook.
